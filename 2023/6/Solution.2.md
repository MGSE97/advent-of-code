# --- Day 6: Wait For It ---

## Solution for Part 2

As the race is about to start, you realize the piece of paper with race times and record distances you got earlier actually just has very bad [kerning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning). There's really **only one race** - ignore the spaces between the numbers on each line.

So, the example from before:

```text
Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
```

...now instead means this:

```text
Time:      71530
Distance:  940200
```

Now, you have to figure out how many ways there are to win this single race. In this example, the race lasts for **`71530` milliseconds** and the record distance you need to beat is **`940200` millimeters**. You could hold the button anywhere from `14` to `71516` milliseconds and beat the record, a total of `**71503**` ways!

**How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?**
